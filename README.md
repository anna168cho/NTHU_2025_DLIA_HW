## **HW2**
1. (20 pts) Select 2 hyper-parameters of the artificial neural network used in Lab 2 and set
3 different values for each. Perform experiments to compare the effects of varying these
hyper-parameters on the loss and accuracy metrics across the training, validation, and test
datasets. Present your findings with appropriate tables.
2. (20 pts) Based on your experiments in Question 1, analyze the outcomes. What
differences do you observe with the changes in hyper-parameters? Discuss whether these
adjustments contributed to improvements in model performance, you can use plots to
support your points. (Approximately 100 words.)
3. (20 pts) In Lab 2, you may have noticed a discrepancy in accuracy between the training
and test datasets. What do you think causes this occurrence? Discuss potential reasons for
the gap in accuracy. (Approximately 100 words.)
4. (20 pts) Discuss methodologies for selecting relevant features in a tabular dataset for
machine learning models. Highlight the importance of feature selection and how it can
impact model performance. You are encouraged to consult external resources to support
your arguments. Please cite any sources you refer to. (Approximately 100 words, ,
excluding reference.)
5. (20 pts) While artificial neural networks (ANNs) are versatile, they may not always be
the most efficient choice for handling tabular data. Identify and describe an alternative
deep learning model that is better suited for tabular datasets. Explain the rationale behind
its design specifically for tabular data, including its key features and advantages. Ensure
you to reference any external sources you consult. (Approximately 150 words, excluding
reference.)
